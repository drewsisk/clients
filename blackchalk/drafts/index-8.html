Founded in 2015, <div class="sticky" style="background-color: #000000; padding:5px;color:#ffffff;">Black Chalk and Co</div> is a creative agency bringing together writers, artists, designers, academics, and technologists with a mutual interest in publishing, archiving, mapping, and curating conversations and exhibitions, and facilitating teaching residencies. What animates all these activities is the effort to engender a new culture and new forms of publishing and creative production. Our work has led to a run of synchronized events, screenings, and public talks. The founding partners, Tinashe Mushakavanhu and Nontsikelelo Mutiti, operate between Harare and Richmond.
