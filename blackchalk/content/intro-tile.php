What animates all these activities is the effort to engender a new culture and new forms of publishing and creative production. Our work has led to a run of synchronized events, screenings, and public talks. The founding partners, Tinashe Mushakavanhu and Nontsikelelo Mutiti, operate between Harare and Richmond, Va.</div>
